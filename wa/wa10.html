Without anyone noticing, he secretly tucked the tiny 5-pound cat into his jacket and jumped into the car to head towards another city in Ethiopia called Shashamane with his family. On the way, everyone heard strange meowing sounds. Harun confidently claimed he was the one meowing! No one suspected a thing.

        Later, as the family gathered to pray in grandma‚Äôs house in Shashamane, Harun silently unleashed the cat into the living room. Suddenly, the little furry cat ran under Harun's older sister Helen's skirt while she was praying! Helen is known to be afraid of cats, so this was not going to end well. A loud scream erupted, interrupting the prayer. The entire family burst into laughter, watching as Helen ran for her life, terrified by the harmless cat.`;
